# ðŸ“„ A brief introduction to the data

The data was collected by a guy who was using a bot to collect data about Kickstarter projects. You can take a look at the data on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects).

# ðŸ›  Used Tools

I used Power BI to analyze and visualize the data. I imported the data that was in CSV extension with Power BI.

# ðŸ“… The data in Power BI

I did the ETL process through Power Query. We can see the final form of the data in the Table View tab.

# ðŸ“Š Dashboard

As we can see, the dashboard view is eye-friendly and very related to the Kickstarter Projects data logo on Kaggle.

# ðŸ§® Some Measures

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/560e8f9a-47be-4b47-9506-2e1d3faf938c)

**Count of Projects:** 375,000 <br>
**Count of Backers:** 40,000,000 <br>
**Total Goal:** $ 18,560,000,000 <br>
**Total Pledged:** $ 2,640,000,000 <br>

# ðŸ“ˆ Count of Projects through the years

I used a **Line Chart** as the common chart with a time series.

It seems that the 2015 year has the highest number of Projects with 74,919 projects

# ðŸ—ƒ States of Projects

I used a **Pie Chart** to visualize this kind of categorical data since the **States of Projects** have only 5 types of categorical data.

It seems that the **Failed** State has more than the half of amount of the projects, Interesting.

# ðŸ—ƒ Categories of Projects

I used a **Treemap** to visualize this kind of categorical data. We can use a **Pie Chart** but a **Treemap** seems clearer with a lot of types of categories. I found out that the most common category is **Film & Video** with 63,000 projects and the 2nd is **Music** with 50,000 projects. We can say that the projects with **entertainment stuff** are on the top.

# ðŸ”Ž Rank of Countries by Count of Projects

I used a **Bar Chart** to show the rank of the countries by count of projects. <br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68d71381-e6e1-4c91-bb4d-d6e346edb05a)

It seems that the country with 1st rank is the **US** since it has 293,000 projects and the country with 2nd rank is the **GB** with 34,000 projects. What a difference !!
